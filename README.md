# Numerical-Method
A numerical method is an approximate computer method for solving a mathematical problem which often has no analytical solution.
Numerical methods are techniques that are used to approximate Mathematical procedures.Â  We need approximations because we either cannot solve the procedure analytically or because the analytical method is intractable (an example is solving a set of a thousand simultaneous linear equations for a thousand unknowns).
